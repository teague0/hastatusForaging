#Flower power

#Derive the energy content per ml of balsa nectar from Kays et al 2012
# - Total nectar produced by a flower is *estimated* at 25.5 ml
# - Each flower produced 11.6 kcal per night
# - Large peak is 60 flowers per patch, but there is a normal distribution of the number of flowers open per patch over the season.
# - Flowers open with 4.9 Â± 1.3 ml of nectar. There is a sharp decline in nectar production over the night. It starts at 2.6 ml / hour and then declines to 0.4 ml per hour.
# - Nectar sugar concentration decreases over the night from 13.3% at 18h to 7.9 % at 06 h. This an average of 12.4% sugar. This is 0.124 g sucrose per ml nectar
# - Roland estimates 11.75 kcal over 1 night (but we don't care about the full night)
# - 3.87 kcal/g sugar
# - 0.47988 kcal per ml (3.87*0.124)
# - 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ
# - 2.007818 kJ / ml nectar
# - peak flower availability is about 60 per patch or 5 per m2. Mean is more like 20 & 2.5 flowers per m2
# - 602.3454 kJ per crown (2.007818 kJ   / ml * 5 ml / flower * 60 flowers per crown) 

#If we assume that bats drain 5 ml of the most profitable nectar
